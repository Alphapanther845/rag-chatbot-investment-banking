📊 Investment Banker RAG Chatbot using Intel's Neural Chat LLM
Welcome to the Investment Banker RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot! This project leverages cutting-edge AI and open-source technologies to provide insightful, real-time information about investment banking. The chatbot is built on Intel's Neural Chat LLM, enhanced with RAG to combine the power of pre-trained language models and retrieval mechanisms, making it highly accurate and contextually aware in generating responses.

🌟 Project Overview
This chatbot aims to assist users in understanding complex investment banking topics by answering queries with precise information sourced from relevant financial documents. The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining retrieved contextual documents with generative models for accurate, real-time answers.

Key Features:
Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot uses Intel's Neural Chat LLM for advanced natural language processing.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The system retrieves relevant documents and uses them to generate more accurate and contextual responses.
Chroma DB Integration: Fast and scalable retrieval of financial documents.
BGE Embeddings: Efficient and accurate embedding generation for semantic understanding.
LangChain Orchestration: To chain various AI models and retrieval mechanisms together seamlessly.
Fast and Responsive: Real-time interaction for fluid user experience.
Professional UI: Clean, responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile devices.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Intel Neural Chat LLM: The core language model that powers natural language understanding.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances the chatbot’s responses by retrieving relevant financial documents from Chroma DB.
Chroma DB: Document retrieval system that stores and retrieves context documents based on user queries.
BGE Embeddings: Embedding generation for better semantic understanding.
LangChain & CTransformers: Frameworks used to orchestrate and manage the different stages of the LLM and retrieval pipeline.
HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript: Frontend technologies for building a clean and responsive user interface.
Flask/Node.js: Backend API to handle user queries and communicate with the chatbot system.
🎯 Use Cases
This chatbot can serve several audiences and use cases:

Investment Bankers: For quick access to industry-relevant information and resources.
Students & Interns: To learn about investment banking processes, terminologies, and insights.
Professionals: For getting answers on specific banking concepts and up-to-date financial data.
🚀 Architecture
1. Frontend
The frontend is a user-friendly interface that captures user queries, handles inputs, and displays real-time responses. It uses HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for the interaction.

2. Backend
The backend uses Flask (or Node.js) to:

Handle API requests from the frontend.
Process user queries by interacting with the Intel Neural Chat LLM.
Retrieve relevant documents from Chroma DB using the BGE embeddings.
Return responses to the frontend, which combine the language model’s generated answer with the retrieved documents.
3. RAG Pipeline
Query Understanding: User input is parsed using Intel Neural Chat LLM.
Document Retrieval: Relevant documents are retrieved from Chroma DB using BGE embeddings.
Answer Generation: A custom RAG pipeline generates answers by fusing the retrieved documents with Intel Neural Chat’s understanding.
Context Display: The response and document context are displayed to the user for reference.

🧑‍💻 Sample Queries
Try asking the chatbot:

"What is an IPO?"
"Explain the role of an underwriter in investment banking."
"What are the risks associated with M&A transactions?"
The chatbot will not only provide a detailed explanation but also display the relevant source documents.
